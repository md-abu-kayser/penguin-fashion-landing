## What this project is:

Penguin Fashion is a small static site template showcasing a minimal, modern landing page for a clothing/brand concept. It's intentionally lightweight and uses Tailwind CSS for rapid styling without custom CSS frameworks. The repository is ideal as:

- A design prototype for marketing pages
- A learning example for Tailwind-based static sites
- A starter for simple brochure-style sites

## Live demo / Preview

Open `index.html` in a browser to preview the page locally. For a fast local dev server (recommended), use a simple static server as shown in the Installation section.

## Built with

- Plain HTML (semantic, accessible structure)
- Tailwind CSS (utility-first styling)
- Small, optimized image assets in `images/`

## Notable features

- Responsive layout across device sizes
- Mobile-first design using Tailwind utilities
- Optimized images and lightweight markup for fast loads
- Accessible semantic HTML (landmarks, descriptive alt text)
- Easy-to-read structure for rapid customization

## Installation & local preview

These instructions assume you have Git and Node.js installed if you want to run npm-based tooling. No build step is required to view the siteit's plain static HTML/CSS.

1. Clone the repository

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Kawser420/penguin-fashion-with-tailwind.git
cd penguin-fashion-with-tailwind
```

2. Preview by opening `index.html` in your browser, or run a simple static server for nicer local dev HTTP handling.

Using Node.js http-server (optional):

```powershell
npx http-server -c-1 -p 8080
# then open http://localhost:8080
```

Using Python 3 (optional):

```powershell
python -m http.server 8080
# then open http://localhost:8080
```

### Development notes

- Tailwind is configured via `tailwind.config.js`. If you want to extend the design system, add custom colors, fonts, or plugins there.
- This project keeps styling inline with Tailwind utility classes in the HTML to remain framework-agnostic and minimal.
- If you prefer a build step (PostCSS, PurgeCSS, autoprefixer), add a Node.js toolchain and update `package.json` accordingly.

### Customization guide

- Changing branding: swap the logo and update text in `index.html`.
- Colors & typography: update `tailwind.config.js` to add brand colors and fonts. Rebuild CSS if using a build pipeline.
- Adding pages: copy `index.html` to a new file and update navigation links. Keep reusable components consistent for maintainability.

### Accessibility & performance

- Semantic HTML elements are used for screen readers and keyboard navigation.
- Images include `alt` attributes; replace them with descriptive content for production.
- Keep images optimized (WebP or appropriately compressed JPG/PNG). Consider adding srcset for responsive images.
- For production, enable Tailwind's purge/just-in-time (JIT) to remove unused CSS and reduce bundle size.

### Project file structure

- `index.html` main landing page
- `tailwind.config.js` Tailwind configuration
- `images/` image assets (logo and brand images)
- `README.md` this file

Add any additional assets or scripts at the root as needed.
